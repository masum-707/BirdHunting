   - You can download Java from: https://download.oracle.com/java/21/latest/jdk-21_windows-x64_bin.exe (sha256)

3. Organize your folder as follows:
   - All your `.java` files (Game.java, Player.java, Bird.java, etc.) should be in the same folder.
   - Place the sound files and images(`.wav`,.png,.jpg files like `play_sound.wav`, `exit_sound.wav`,Play.png,Rules.jpg etc.) in the same folder.
